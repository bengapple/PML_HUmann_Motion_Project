### Executive Summary
Using a Random Forest classification algorithm, it was possible to achieve an estimated 1.5% sample error rate with a Kappa value of .98 these vaues indicate a well fitting model. The original data set contained 160 variables for this model that number was redueced to 53 variables of interest. It is ecpected that the Out of Sample Error rate will be 99% with a 95% confidence interval.

When the model was applied against the test data set the model produced a 20 out of 20 correct predictions. 

### Background
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. The goal of this project is to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. The participants were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. The data from accelerometer is used in the following study. 

### Project Description
Participants in a study were asked to perform various weight lifting exercises while wearing accelerometers (including accelerometers on the weights).  The data was used to try to predict if the exercises where done correctly.  A full description of the test can be found here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har.  

For this project, we were provided two sets of data collected from accelerometers worn by participants (and on the weights) while they performed a barbell lift. They were instructed how to do it correctly, and also how to do it incorrectly in 5 different ways. 

Using this data, this project attempts to predict whether the exercise was done correctly, or incorrectly in one of 5 different ways. 

### Data Analysis and Grooming
Two sets of accelerometer readings data were provided. The first was a training set was 19,622 observations of 160 variables, including the predicted variable indicating correct or incorrect technique. The second set was 20 observations of the same 160 variables, with the variable indicating correct or incorrect technique replaced with a dummy variable. 

Upon observation of the Training data, it was noted that there were variables which were empty or had values of NA for all observations.  These variables were removed from the training data with the corresponding variables removed from the testing data. The first seven variables of both data sets contained data which was not relevant to the model therefore these variables were removed. The irrelevant variables were number, user name, raw time 1, raw time 2, converted time, and two variables relating to window information.

The remaining 53 variable in the respective data sets were deamed as relevant. Using the training data, the variables were tested for Near Zero Covariates. None were found.  No further transformation or manipulation of the data took place. Below are the rsults of the test.

### Model Selection and Fit Analysis
The training data set was partitioned into a training set (train) and testing set (test), with 70% in the training set and 30% in the testing set.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
set.seed(73821)
inTrain<-createDataPartition(training$classe, p=.7, list=F)
train <- training[inTrain,]
test <- training[-inTrain,]
```

The train data was used to build a Random Forest model with the number of trees limited to 50 to improve the run time. The Random Forrest model was chosen due to the non-linear relationship between the variables and the accuracy of these types of models.

```{r, eval=F}
modFit <- train(classe ~., data=train, method="rf", ntree=50, prox=TRUE)
```

The resulting model (modFit) provided an accuracy of 98.5% with an Kappa of .981. The model results were:

```{r, eval=F}
modFit
```

Accuracy was used to select the optimal model using  the largest value.  
The final value used for the model was mtry = 27.   
```
  
The variable importance was then checked to determine if any variable could be removed from the model. Even though the importance begins to drop off after the first 20 variables as seen using the varImp function, it was decided to keep all variables.

### Out of Sample Error Expectation
The train data, which was the 30% partition from the original Training, was then used to estimate the out of sample error of the model. The confusionMatix indicates a very good fit with an accuracy of 99% and a 95% confidence interval for the accuracy of [0.989, 0.993].

### Predictions against Testing Data
Using the model defined above, the weight lifting correct/incorrectness was predicting for the 20 observations in the test set. The predicted results were

```{r, eval=FALSE}


testing_prediction <- predict(RF_model, test)
testing_prediction <- as.character(testing_prediction)
testing_prediction

pml_write_files = function(x){
  n = length(x)
  for(i in 1:n){
    filename = paste0("problem_id_",i,".txt")
    write.table(x[i],file=filename,quote=FALSE,row.names=FALSE,col.names=FALSE)
  }
}

pml_write_files(testing_prediction)
testing_prediction
```

```
[1] "B" "A" "B" "A" "A" "E" "D" "B" "A" "A" "B" "C" "B" "A" "E" "E" "A" "B" "B" "B"
```

When these values were submitted for project results, all 20 of the 20 were evaluated as correct.

### Conclusion
Given accelerometer data from a barbell lifting exercise being performed, it is possible to accurate determine if the exercise was performed correctly, and if not correct, in which way was it incorrect. It is expected that the same success could likely be expected from other weight lifting exercises, however it was not tested using this model.
